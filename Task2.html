    <p class="small--text">
        On March 21 2023, several prominent and established teachers at the ed-tech company alleged that their vision of
        the company is being disillusioned and in response started an independent YouTube channel by the name,
        'Sankalp'.[9] They said that their resignation at PW was because of the atmosphere at the company and that at
        the Kota centre of PW, students were not getting the quality education worth their tuition fee.[10]

        In response, a teacher of the company, Pankaj Sijairya, alleged in a video that the three ex-PW teachers â€“ Tarun
        Kumar, Manish Dubey, and Sarvesh Dixit were offered INR 5 Cr each to resign from Physics Wallah and join the
        rival company, Adda247.[11] The three teachers, in a video claimed that Pankaj Sijairya falsely accused them of
        accepting bribes from rival platform Adda247.[12]
